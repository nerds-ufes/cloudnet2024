## Description

This repository contains datasets and analysis used in the research **"Early Detection and Classification of Malicious Activities in Network and Cloud Services."** The paper addresses the early detection of malicious activities across network and cloud services, with a focus on scanning activities, web-based attacks, and Tor network anomalies.

The datasets are derived from real-world network activities, anonymized to ensure privacy. IP addresses (both source and destination) have been anonymized for security reasons.

### Datasets

The datasets consist of five main categories, each focusing on different types of attacks:

| **Dataset**              | **Attack Types**                                                                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Tor Network Test**      | Tor client connection to entry node                                                                    | A second set of data from Tor network traffic, used for test and validation with the first dataset. <br> Files: `dataset_tor_test_part_1.csv` to `dataset_tor_test_part_10.csv`.                                                                                                                                       |


### Anonymization

For security and privacy, all IP addresses (source and destination) have been anonymized. 

### Dataset Structure

The **Scan** and **Web Attack** datasets are divided into two distinct files:
1. **Connection Data** - Generated using [Zeek](https://zeek.org/), this file contains connection-level information.
2. **Flow Data** - Generated using the [FlowMeter module for Zeek](https://github.com/zeek-flowmeter/zeek-flowmeter), developed through the [CICFlowmeter](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter) project, this file contains detailed flow statistics.

You can merge these two files using the `uid` field, which uniquely identifies each session across both files.
